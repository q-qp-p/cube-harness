"""EventStreamer — the trajectory's event fan-out + per-episode stats.

The streamer is attached to each event-producing component:

  - `LLM.attach_recorder(streamer)` — every `.call()` emits an
    `LLMCallEvent`. The streamer stashes the latest `LLMCallEvent.id`
    so subsequent `ToolCallEvent`s can parent under it.
  - `MonitoredTool` (Episode-installed) — every `.execute_action()`
    emits a `ToolCallEvent` with `parent_event_id` resolved via the
    streamer's `current_parent_event_id()` getter.

From the agent's POV the streamer is invisible: code is just
`await self.llm.call(prompt)` + `await env_tool.execute_action(action)`.

Episode-only helpers (`record_reset`, `record_failure`,
`record_evaluation`) remain on this object — they emit synthetic events
at trajectory boundaries that no component naturally owns.

Per-episode stats (n_llm_calls, n_tool_calls, n_evaluations,
total_actions, tokens, cost, first error, ...) are folded INSIDE the
streamer as events flow through. `summary_stats()` returns the final
dict — what previously lived on a separate `SummaryProcessor`. No
per-event jsonl is written; the dict in `TrajectoryMetadata` is the
single source of truth.

`EventStreamerConfig` is the forward seam for multi-sink fan-out:
FileStorage today; OTel + RL HTTP + custom sinks land via additive
config fields without changing this surface.

    (HTTP, disk-fsync), do it in a background queue.
