        1. **Propagate to held LLMs** so `LLM.call(...)` auto-emits
           `LLMCallEvent`. Multi-LLM agents call `.attach_recorder()` on
           each LLM they want recorded; LLMs whose calls should NOT

        2. **Reach the live `Budget`** for graceful self-stop /

            on the calling thread — sync tools (Playwright, shell) work natively and
            pdb lands in a single stack with no thread hops.

          * `True` → `_arun` (async body). Spins its own `asyncio.run` scoped to the
            parallel gather — the event loop lives only here, not in Episode.

        `env_tool` is any `AbstractTool` — `Tool.execute_action` and
        `Tool.async_execute_action` both handle sync and async `@tool_action`
        methods, bridging when caller and method differ. The agent picks the
        dispatch shape; the tool doesn't need to know.

        The recorder is attached out-of-band via `attach_recorder()` before `run` is
        called; LLM/tool events auto-emit. `self._recorder.budget` is available for
        self-stop.
