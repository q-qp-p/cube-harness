"""`general_blame` — the default investigator recipe.

Output schema is identical to `BaseFindings`, preserving on-disk
compatibility for the default investigator path. Subclassing without adding fields
gives the recipe a class identity (so it can declare `output_model`) without
changing the JSON shape.

Prompts are defined inline rather than in a sibling `prompt.py` module —
this matches the `profiling/` and `agent_scaffolding/` pattern (each use case
is a self-contained directory) and lets the user-prompt template derive its
JSON example directly from `BaseFindings` via `model_to_json_example`.
That single-source-of-truth pattern is the same one the meta-analysis prompt
uses; renaming or reordering a field on `BaseFindings` updates the prompt
automatically.

Hallucination rules (strict):
- Every blame attribution must be backed by a verbatim quote from the transcript.
- Categories are closed-world. Pick from the taxonomy or use `none`. Do not invent.
- Confidence is on a 0-5 scale. Use 2 or below when the evidence is thin and say so.
- Write `analysis` first as a scratchpad. Your structured fields must be consistent with it.

Your final response MUST be a single JSON object inside ```json ... ``` fences.
No other text after the closing fence."""

A one-time orientation to the code that ran this experiment — what
cube-standard and cube-harness are, and where this benchmark's pieces
live on disk. **Navigate freely** with `Glob` / `Grep` / `Read`: this
is a head-start, not a boundary. Read any file you need to back a
claim; let your hypotheses drive what you open.

# Output schema

Produce a single JSON object with these fields, in this order. The order is
deliberate — emit your reasoning and evidence first, then commit to the
structured fields, then score them. Models reason better when they think
before they classify. Each leaf is annotated `<type — description>`:

```json
{_FINDINGS_JSON}
```

Outcome semantics:
  success                   — solved correctly
  success_lucky             — reward=1 but reached by accident or wrong approach
  almost                    — right strategy, failed on a minor technical detail
  failure                   — task not solved
  should_have_been_rewarded — agent did the right thing but eval rejected it

Blame semantics:
  task_unclear              — task description ambiguous or missing context
  model_capability          — agent understood task, lacked reasoning to solve
  tool_failure              — tool wrapper bug / unexpected exception
  env_failure               — container crash, network timeout, infra
  agent_scaffolding         — system prompt, budget, context mgmt, submission protocol
  action_space_limited      — required action does not exist in tool set
  insufficient_observation  — observation missing crucial info (truncation, pruning)
  eval_brittle              — evaluator rejected a correct solution
  submission_format         — agent reached solution but submitted wrong way
  none                      — clean success or too ambiguous to attribute

Invariants:
- Evidence MUST be non-empty when primary_blame != "none".
- other_blames MUST NOT repeat primary_blame.
- On clean success, primary_blame must be "none"."""
