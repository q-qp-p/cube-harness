"""WorkArena task hints and precision for the Genny agent.

Exports two dicts consumed by GennyConfig:

- WORKARENA_TASK_PRECISION: task_id -> text that clarifies an under-defined goal.
  These belong in the task description but are maintained here until WorkArena upstream
  is updated. Injected as part of the goal context ("Additional task details").

- WORKARENA_TASK_HINTS: task_id -> general or task-specific guidance that helps the LLM
  work faster/better. A strong LLM should eventually solve the task without these, but
  they reduce wasted turns. Injected as a separate "Task Hint" section.

Usage:
    from workarena_hints import WORKARENA_TASK_HINTS, WORKARENA_TASK_PRECISION

    agent_config = GennyConfig(
        ...
        task_hints=WORKARENA_TASK_HINTS,
        task_precision=WORKARENA_TASK_PRECISION,
    )

# Task precision — the goal description is under-defined
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These fix cases where a competent LLM cannot know what is expected without
# extra information that the task goal should have provided.

# Sort: goal says "sort by X" but doesn't say to use the filter UI.
# Column header clicks look correct but don't update the sysparm_query URL
# parameter that WorkArena's verifier checks.
_SORT_PRECISION: str = (
    "Use the filter panel (funnel icon) to set sort order — "
    "do NOT click column headers. Column header sorting is not reflected "
    "in the validated configuration."
)

# Filter: goal says "filter by X" but doesn't describe the filter UI workflow.
_FILTER_PRECISION: str = "Use the filter panel (funnel icon) to add filter conditions."

# Chart (single/multi value): goal asks a question but doesn't specify the answer format.
_CHART_VALUE_PRECISION: str = (
    "Answer with ONLY the numeric value — no units, labels, or explanation. Example: send_message('42.5')"
)

# Chart min/max (single or multi): answer format is 'label, count', not just a number.
# The task goal itself says "Give me both the label and the count."
_CHART_MINMAX_PRECISION: str = (
    "Answer with both the label and the count, comma-separated. Example: send_message('2026-01-19, 18')"
)

# Impersonation: LLMs sometimes refuse "impersonation" as a real-world privacy violation.
# It is a built-in ServiceNow admin feature — administrators routinely switch to another user's
# session to troubleshoot permissions. Must clarify this is legitimate AND give the nav path.

    "administrative task, not a real-world privacy violation. "
    "To impersonate: click the profile avatar (top-right corner) → select 'Impersonate User' "
    "→ search for the user by name → click their row to activate impersonation."

# mention that submit_form() is the correct submission method.
_CREATE_PRECISION: str = (

    "When all fields are set, call submit_form() to submit. "
