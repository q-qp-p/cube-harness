# Agents guide — cube-harness

*(Served as both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` — the latter is a symlink.)*

You are working in **cube-harness**, the runtime that executes agents against CUBE
benchmarks and records trajectories. This file is your map; it is deliberately short.
Read the relevant spec in `openspec/specs/` before modifying any layer.

## What this repo is

cube-harness runs experiments. It consumes the contracts defined by **cube-standard**
(`Task`, `Benchmark`, `Tool`, `Resource`) and adds: agents, episode loops,
trajectory storage, OTel tracing, parallel execution (Ray), the XRay viewer, and
MCP server bridges.

It does NOT define the task/benchmark/tool protocol — that's cube-standard. If you're
tempted to change base class signatures (`Task.step`, `Benchmark.setup`, etc.), you're
in the wrong repo; go to cube-standard and start with an openspec change proposal.

## Spec index

Read the spec, then the code. Each spec is the authoritative contract for its layer.

| Layer | Module | Spec |
|-------|--------|------|
| Core types (Trajectory, AgentOutput) | `cube_harness.core` | [core/spec.md](openspec/specs/core/spec.md) |
| Agent | `cube_harness.agent` | [agent/spec.md](openspec/specs/agent/spec.md) |
| Tool (telemetry wrapper) | `cube_harness.tool` | [tool/spec.md](openspec/specs/tool/spec.md) |
| LLM wrapper | `cube_harness.llm` | [llm/spec.md](openspec/specs/llm/spec.md) |
| Episode | `cube_harness.episode` | [episode/spec.md](openspec/specs/episode/spec.md) |
| Experiment + runners | `cube_harness.experiment`, `cube_harness.exp_runner` | [experiment/spec.md](openspec/specs/experiment/spec.md) |
| Storage | `cube_harness.storage`, `cube_harness.summary` | [storage/spec.md](openspec/specs/storage/spec.md) |
| Metrics / OTel | `cube_harness.metrics` | [metrics/spec.md](openspec/specs/metrics/spec.md) |
| XRay viewer | `cube_harness.analyze` | [analyze/spec.md](openspec/specs/analyze/spec.md) |
| MCP server | `cube_harness.mcp` | [mcp/spec.md](openspec/specs/mcp/spec.md) |

**External contracts (cube-standard):** Any field typed as `cube.task.Task`,
`cube.benchmark.Benchmark`, `cube.tool.Tool`, `cube.core.*`, or `cube.resource.*`
is governed by cube-standard's specs. Don't subclass those here — consume them.

## Workflow for code changes

1. **Find the relevant spec** — which layer? Start there.
2. **Check "Invariants" and "Gotchas"** — these are the traps.
3. **Check `openspec/changes/`** — someone may already be proposing your change.
4. **For substantive contract changes**, write a delta spec
   (`openspec/changes/<name>/deltas.md` with ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED sections)
   before coding. Archive to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/` when done.
5. **Constitution alignment:** every change is reviewed against the
   [constitution](.claude/rules/constitution.md) and [review rules](.claude/rules/review-rules.md).

## Key conventions (already enforced in code)

- **Python is the configuration** — no YAML/Hydra. `AgentConfig`, `LLMConfig`,
  `Experiment` are all Pydantic `TypedBaseModel`.
- **LiteLLM is the only LLM gateway** — never import `openai`, `anthropic`, etc. directly.
- **Module-level imports only** — no function-scoped imports (EX-001).
- **Type hints required everywhere**, including tests (CC-001).
- **Serialization boundary:** Workers receive `TaskConfig` + `EpisodeConfig` (pickled).
  Live `Task`, `Tool`, `Benchmark`, `Agent` objects never cross process boundaries.
- **Trajectory steps alternate** env → agent → env → agent in persistence order.
- **Trace-first:** every new long-running operation should get a `tracer.span()`.

## Development commands

```bash
make install            # uv sync --all-extras
make test               # full pytest
make debug              # small end-to-end run
make xray               # open the trajectory viewer
make lint
make review PR=<n>      # check out a PR and wire up any cross-repo cube-standard dependency
uv run recipes/hello_miniwob.py   # example run
```

Environment vars go in `.env` (loaded by pyproject). `OPENAI_API_KEY`
is the only required one for the baseline recipes; see individual cubes for others.

### Launch contract — recipes with Ray

Always launch recipe scripts from the project root using the project venv:

```bash
.venv/bin/python recipes/my_recipe.py       # explicit — always correct
uv run --active recipes/my_recipe.py        # correct when the project venv is already active
```

**Do not** use bare `uv run recipes/my_recipe.py` when `VIRTUAL_ENV` is already set to a
different path (e.g. inside a Claude worktree). uv will ignore the mismatch and create an
ephemeral environment in `~/.cache/uv/environments-v2/` whose `.pth` files can point to
deleted paths. Ray workers inherit that environment and will fail with `ImportError` on any
editable-installed cube package. `exp_runner.py` will emit a warning when it detects this
condition.

## Cross-repo PRs (cube-harness ↔ cube-standard)

When a PR depends on an unreleased cube-standard branch, do **not** commit
`path = "..."` local sources to any `pyproject.toml` (root or under `cubes/`).
The pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) will block this — local paths break
for anyone with a different folder structure.

**Authoring a cross-repo PR:**

1. Keep `pyproject.toml` pointing at PyPI (or a git ref) — do **not** commit the local path.
2. Add a line starting with `Depends-on: cube-standard/<branch-name>` to the PR description body. The line must start at column 0 (no leading whitespace, not inside a list or quote block).

**Reviewing a cross-repo PR:**

```bash
make review PR=<n>
```

This checks out the PR branch, reads `Depends-on:` from the PR description, clones
`cube-standard` into the repo root (gitignored), checks out the correct branch, and
installs all workspace packages with `uv pip install -e cube-standard --all-packages --all-extras`.

## What lives elsewhere

- **cube-standard** — protocol and base classes. Never subclass cube-standard ABCs
  here without first updating cube-standard's openspec if needed.
- **cube-registry** — public metadata registry; `cube registry add` submits entries.
- **cubes/\*** — individual benchmark packages. Each has its own `debug.py` that
  `cube test <name>` runs. Changes to a cube are usually local to its directory.

## Meta-agent

`meta_agent/` holds an iterative eval-analyze-fix loop used for improving agents.
The skill `/meta-agent` drives it (see `.claude/skills/meta-agent/`). Journal
entries live in `meta_agent/journal/` for historical context — not part of the
build.
