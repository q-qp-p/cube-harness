"""Recipe guards: imports resolve, and each recipe builds a valid Experiment.

1. `test_recipe_local_imports_resolve` — static AST walk: every
   `from <local pkg> import Y` in a recipe resolves. Catches the class of bug
   that broke #381 (a recipe importing a symbol another PR deleted).
2. `test_recipe_defines_experiment` — executes the recipe (as `__main__`, with
   `run()` stubbed) and asserts it yields an `Experiment` — assigned at module
   level OR passed to `run()` by a lazy builder (the gold-patch recipes build
   their Experiments inside `__main__` to avoid creating output dirs at import).
   Catches config-schema drift: a renamed config field fails here, not at next run.

Covers both the top-level `recipes/` and the per-cube recipe modules under
`cubes/*/` — the entry points downstream users hit first. No Docker, no network,
no LLM (`run()` is stubbed). Recipes whose cube/tool deps aren't installed in this
env are skipped, not failed — local dev with the cube installed asserts for real.
