        NON-ROOT DOCKER WORKAROUND. Upstream SWE-bench images assume `USER root`
        (matched by Daytona, local Docker, AWS, Azure) and bake conda+sources
        into a root-owned /testbed. On non-root infras — the EAI Toolkit enforces
        uid 13011 by cluster policy — the runtime user can't `chmod` root-owned
        files in place, can't write to a read-only /testbed, and Git 2.35.2+
        rejects repos owned by a different user. This block normalises all three
        before the tool is constructed. Root-running infras short-circuit at the
        writability probes and pay essentially nothing.

        Two pre-flight fixes applied unconditionally:
        1. git safe.directory: Git 2.35.2+ refuses to operate in repos owned by a
           different user. Configure /testbed as safe so agents can run `git diff`.
        2. chmod via cp/mv: some containers ship root-owned 644 .py files inside a
           world-writable /testbed. mv unlinks via the writable parent and recreates
           with the runtime user's ownership, making every file writable without sudo.
           Running before relocate_if_readonly keeps conda editable-install paths stable.

        The trailing ``relocate_if_readonly`` call falls back to /tmp/testbed

#              (/testbed/requests/) -> git apply "Permission denied" -> a correct
#              patch (gold or agent) silently scores 0.
#   invariant: a writability defect of the infra must NOT masquerade as an agent
#              failure (reward 0). Fail loud (IncompatibleInfraError) instead.
#   why:       band-aid — detects the unpatchable dir at _make_tool and raises the
#              cube's IncompatibleInfraError (terminal/non-retriable). The full
#              resolution (declare container:root vs skip vs relocate) is the
#              design decision tracked in #446; no in-place non-root fix exists.
#   tested:    scripts/smoke/nonroot_unpatchable_faill0ud.py (requests-1142 raises;
#              writable tasks no-op).
#   hash=PENDING: stamped by scripts/auto_fix_lint.py (Tier-1) on first run.
