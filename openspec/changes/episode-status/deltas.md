# Deltas — Episode Status File

Applies to: `openspec/specs/episode/spec.md`, `openspec/specs/experiment/spec.md`,
`openspec/specs/storage/spec.md`

---

## episode/spec.md

### ADDED — `EpisodeStatus` dataclass

```python
@dataclass
class EpisodeStatus:
    status: Literal["RUNNING", "COMPLETED", "FAILED", "CANCELLED"]
    task_id: str
    episode_id: int
    started_at: float
    ended_at: float | None = None
    last_heartbeat_at: float | None = None
    reward: float | None = None
    had_step_errors: bool = False
    retry_count: int = 0
```

### MODIFIED — `Episode._run_loop` lifecycle

Before (no status file):
- Trajectory written incrementally; no terminal signal on crash.

After:
1. Write `status=RUNNING` via `storage.write_episode_status()` before `setup_fn()`
2. Start background heartbeat thread (30s interval, updates `last_heartbeat_at`)
3. In `finally`: stop heartbeat thread; write `status=COMPLETED` or `status=FAILED`

### INVARIANT

`status.json` is always written before any step file. A missing `status.json` means
the worker died before the episode could initialise — treat as retriable.

---

## experiment/spec.md

### REMOVED — `_is_trajectory_successful`

Replaced entirely by status file check. Trajectory deserialization is no longer part
of the retry decision path.

### MODIFIED — Resume / retry semantics table

| `resume` | `retry_failed` | Episodes returned |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| False    | False          | All episodes from scratch |
| True     | False          | Episodes with no `status.json` or `status != COMPLETED` with `status == RUNNING` and stale heartbeat — i.e. unstarted |
| False    | True           | Episodes with `status IN (FAILED, CANCELLED)` or stale RUNNING, AND `retry_count < max_retries` |
| True     | True           | Unstarted ∪ failed/cancelled |

### ADDED — `max_retries: int = 3` field on `Experiment`

Controls how many times a failed episode is retried. Episodes at `retry_count >= max_retries`
are reported as permanently failed and skipped.

### MODIFIED — `_load_completed_trajectory_ids` (replaces `_load_successful_trajectory_ids`)

Reads only `status.json` per episode directory. No trajectory deserialization.

Stale RUNNING detection: `now - last_heartbeat_at > 120` seconds.

---

## storage/spec.md

### ADDED — `Storage` Protocol methods

```python
def write_episode_status(self, trajectory_id: str, status: EpisodeStatus) -> None
    # Atomic: write to .tmp, then os.replace()

def read_episode_status(self, trajectory_id: str) -> EpisodeStatus | None
    # Returns None if status.json does not exist
```

### ADDED — `FileStorage` implementation

- `write_episode_status`: serialises `EpisodeStatus` to JSON, writes atomically via
  a `.tmp` sibling file + `os.replace()`.
- `read_episode_status`: reads `<episode_dir>/status.json`; returns `None` on missing file.

---

## exp_runner.py (not a spec file — implementation note)

After `ray.cancel(ref, force=True)`, write `status=CANCELLED` for that episode via
`storage.write_episode_status()`. Increment `retry_count` by reading the current
status first.
